### Releasing New Versions

When a tagged branch with `v*` is pushed, a new release with that reference will be created and all crates in the workspace will be automatically published to crates.io. See the note below about version management.

#### Versioning

Version control is handled by the CI workflow using `cargo cvm -x` to check against the `master` or target branch. If the version has not been updated, the CI will error with a message of which crate(s) have outdated versions. If a version is outdated, the developer can run `cargo cvm -f -s [`major`, `minor` or `patch`]` to automatically bump the crate's version. 

> NOTE: If you run this in the workspace root, it will update all workspace crate versions. If this is not desired, run the command in the crate directory.
